# Evolution Sim 

A Python simulation of species evolving over time using random mutations, selection, and biomechanical constraints (like muscle, bone, and weird-ass leg joints).

## Features
- Simulates walking species with different connection types
- Mutation and selection process
- Graphs of fitness over time
- Supports adding new biomechanical links (like springy tendons, ratchets, etc)

## How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py
